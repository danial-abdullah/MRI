# MRI Image Reconstriction

## Introduction

My name is Danial and welcome to my GitHub page. This page was started as a means to share code amongst a community of developing researchers in Pre-Clinical and Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imagery research. As the newest member of the Methods Development Group in SBIC and a beginner to the world of MRI research, this page was created as a medium for the 'MRI Study Group' to share their learning experiences through code.

## Goals of This Project

The purpose of this project is to share MRI Image Reconstruction algorithims to both the beginners and advanced researchers of Magnetic Resonance Imagery. It is a shared space for the MRI community to upload and share their work. The growth of the repositery would be an opportunity to display the vast knowledge applied in the use of MRI. 

This could lead to an increase interest in the field and act as an outreach to young researchers.


## Acknowledgements

The raw data reconstruction is based on the Python module brukerMRI originally done by jdoepfert to read in Bruker MRI files (parameter files, raw data, processed data).
